                <p class="mb-lg">Have you ever blinked and felt like the little one in your life has grown an inch? One
                    day they're
                    telling you all about their favorite dinosaur, and the next, they have a whole new world of friends,
                    hobbies, and big ideas. It's a beautiful thing to watch, but in our busy, fast-paced world, staying
                    deeply connected through it all can be a challenge.</p>
                <p>We wanted to create something to protect and nurture that precious bond. We dreamed of a way to
                    bridge the distance—whether it's miles or just busy schedules—and create a space for genuine, joyful
                    connection.</p>
